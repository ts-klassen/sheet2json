You are running inside **Codex CLI** and `requirements.md` for the feature already exists.

Objective: Produce the **design document** for the feature, based on `requirements.md`.

Steps:
1. Read the existing file `workbench/specs/*/requirements.md` (there will be only one new-feature directory) to understand the approved requirements.
2. Re-use the same *feature directory* and create `design.md` alongside the requirements file (overwrite if it already exists).
3. Use `apply_patch` to write `design.md` with all of the sections listed below, then **stop** – do not generate `tasks.md` yet.

Required sections (in this order):
  - Overview
  - Architecture
  - Components and Interfaces
  - Data Models
  - Error Handling
  - Testing Strategy

Additional rules (from the extension workflow):
• Summarise any background research directly in the relevant sections; do not create separate research files.
• Include diagrams (Mermaid) where helpful.
• Explain key design decisions and their rationales.
• Ensure every requirement from `requirements.md` is addressed.

After the `apply_patch` call, output nothing else.
