# Workbench

This directory houses all forward-looking planning artifacts for the project—requirements, designs, roadmaps, and day-to-day task lists. Treat it as the project’s workspace where raw ideas are shaped into actionable work.

Suggested structure (adapt or ignore):

- requirements.md – functional & non-functional requirements
- roadmap.md – high-level milestones
- design_notes/ – richer technical design docs
- todos.md – running to-do list for the team or AI agent
